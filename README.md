🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python with FastAPI, utilizing Hugging Face Transformers for AI-driven lyric generation.
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
Database: PostgreSQL for efficient storage of user data and generated lyrics.
Submodules: BeatSample-Organizer for sample management and integration.
Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated on AWS for scalability and reliability.

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone [repository-url]


Initialize submodules:
git submodule update --init


Install backend dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install frontend dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install


⚙️ MVP Setup & Run (Fast)

What I changed for the MVP
- Added a minimal FastAPI backend at `backend/main.py` that exposes `POST /api/lyrics/generate` and returns deterministic placeholder lyrics.
- Created `backend/requirements.txt` (FastAPI + Uvicorn).
- Reworked the root `index.html` into a small Tailwind-powered single-page app that calls the backend and displays generated lyrics.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1) Create and activate a virtual environment:

  python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

2) Install backend dependencies:

  pip install -r backend\requirements.txt

3) Start the backend (in a terminal):

  uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

4) Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required for the MVP UI). The page will POST to `http://localhost:8000/api/lyrics/generate`.

Notes
- This MVP avoids complex AI model installs to keep things reproducible locally. The backend contains a simple placeholder generator that you can later swap with calls to Hugging Face or an internal model.
- For a production-ready app, move the frontend into a React project, secure CORS, add authentication, and integrate a true lyric-generation model and a database.
